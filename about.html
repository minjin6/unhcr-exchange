				<p class="kicker">UNHCR  Exchange is a tool and methodology to assist you in running successful learning and collaboration projects through two way communications between refugees and practitioners.</p>
					<p>Exchange offers online communities of practice and learning to accompany your face to face learning and collaboration projects in areas such as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Capacity Building Projects, including continuous peer to peer coaching</li>
						<li>Learning programmes for refugees</li>
						<li>Collaborative Learning experiences between refugees and practitioners </li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>Innovation projects and idea generation</li>
						<li>Exchange of Best Practice</li>
						<li>Staff training (for UNHCR Staff and implementing partners )</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The system runs on computers (in browser), tablets and smartphones (in the app). Besides allowing for easy access to content,  Exchange emphasises user generated content: Users can upload any type of media and comment on each otherâ€™s content to further ideas in collaboration.</p>
					<p>The Exchange experience works best when combining online and face to face experiences. The platform then becomes the assistive learning Tool to enhance a specific learning programme.</p>
